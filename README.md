## Description
Website with 3 pages, one for Google Search, one for Image Search and one for Advanced Search. The basic functionality was relatively easy to figure out, the most difficult part was to Style the website with CSS. It uses Flexbox. It's not responsive yet.

## Forms
- action attribute points to "https://google.com/search"
- name attribute from the input defines the "key" for the type of search
- value attribute from the input defines the text that we want to search
- When the form is submitted, the key-value pairs are concatenated to the url in the action

## CSS Styles
- The CSS Styles try to resemble the aesthetics from Google

## Files:
- index.html
- imageSearch.html
- advancedSearch.html
- styles.css

V1: 2022-April-06
Web app already working correctly, but I've not used redirections at the end of functions like random_page, new_page, edit_page... Instead they just render the page and the content at the end of the functions, but the URL is incorrect in the bar.
